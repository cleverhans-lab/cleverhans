# Defenses [Future]

In the future, this folder will be at the root of this repository `//defenses`.

This folder contains implementations of defenses (as standalone scripts) in one
of the three frameworks (JAX, PyTorch, TF2). Each defense should be implemented
as a script that helps reproduce results reported in the paper introducing the
defense. The goal is for these scripts to be authoritative ways to reproduce
the defense.

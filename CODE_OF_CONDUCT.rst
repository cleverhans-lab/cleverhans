CleverHans is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or
religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all CleverHans spaces (including Gist
comments) both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of
conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the
discretion of the OpenAI / Pennsylvania State University team.

We may add additional rules over time, which will be made clearly
available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing
and abiding by these rules.

# pylint should print out the file path, line number, and ID code for the
# messages it prints. This is partly so we can turn off the ID codes that
# we do not actually want to enforce.
msg-template='{path}:{line}: [{msg_id}({symbol}), {obj}] {msg}'

# ID codes to disable
# C0103: Complains about the variable name 'x'
# C0111: Missing docstring
# W0613: Unused argument
#  This one is disabled because pylint does not implement it well.
#  In many cases we use all arguments via `locals()` and pylint does not
#  detect them as used.
# E1101: pylint seems to have a bug. Says numpy.random has no member RandomState
# E0611: pylint seems to have a bug. Complains about imports of tensorflow
# R0913: Too many arguments
# R0914: Too many local variables
# W0223: doesn't allow subclass of an abstract base class to still be abstract
# E0203: pylint seems to have a bug. Doesn't know self.x can be defined before
#        method call.
# W0201: doesn't let any attributes be added outside __init__
# C1801: do not use len(s) to tell if s is empty
# E1129: a check on context managers
#  This is disabled because it complains about "with sess.as_default".
#  pylint does not seem to believe that that is a real context manager.
# C0325: unnecessary parens (sometimes we use them to be extra-explicit)
# R1705: "unnecessary else after return"
#  We disable this one because it is annoying. It forbids
#  if a:
#    return b
#  else:
#    return c
#  The name "unnecessary else after return" seems misleading, and it would be
#  annoying and use more lines to rewrite everything as:
#  if a:
#    out = b
#  else:
#    out = c
#  return out
# W0621: redefining name
# W0703: catching too general exception
# W0101: unreachable code
# W0122: use of exec
# R0912: too many branches
# R0903: too few public methods
# W0221: parameters differ from overridden method
# W0212: protected access
# R1703: simplifiable if statement
# R0201: method could be a function
# W0603: global statement
# R0915: too many statements
# R1704: redefining argument
# R0902: too many attributes
# C0200: consider using enumerate
# W1201: logging not lazy
# W1202: logging format
# C0302: too many lines in module
# W0511: forbids TODOs
# W0108: unnecessary lambda
# C0412: import grouping
# R0911: too many return statements
# W0222: signature differs
# E0401: cannot import module
# R0205: this one is apparently asking us to drop python 2 support?
# R1714: use x in [a,b] instead of x == a or x == b
# R1718: didn't look closely at what it is
# W0143: didn't look closely at what it is
# W1505: didn't look closely at what it is
# R1707: didn't look closely at what it is
# R1717: didn't look closely at what it is
# R0801: duplicate code across files
#        (We have a lot of intentional duplication, like the tutorials)
# R0401: cyclic import

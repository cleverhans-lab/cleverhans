"""
Plots a success-fail curve ( https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1g0piA9tQ )
Usage:
plot_success_fail_curve.py model.joblib
plot_success_fail_curve.py model1.joblib model2.joblib

This script is mostly intended to rapidly visualize success-fail curves
during model development and testing.
To make nicely labeled plots formatted to fit the page / column of a
publication, you should probably write your own script that calls some
of the same plotting commands.

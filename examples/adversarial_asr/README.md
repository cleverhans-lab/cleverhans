# Imperceptible, Robust and Targeted Adversarial Examples for Automatic Speech Recognition

### Introduction
This is a Tensorflow implementation for the ICML 2019 paper "Imperceptible, Robust and Targeted Adversarial Examples for Automatic Speech Recognition". The details of all the models implemented here can be found in our [paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/qin19a.html).

## Dependencies

The code is [based on the Lingvo system](https://github.com/tensorflow/lingvo).
*   a TensorFlow [installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) (for now
    tf-nightly-gpu is required),
*   a `C++` compiler (only g++ 4.8 is officially supported), and
*   the bazel build system.

## Quick Start

This example provides a CleverHans wrapper for the Madry Lab challenges.

To run the attack on MNIST:

1. Clone the MNIST challenge repository from:
https://github.com/MadryLab/mnist_challenge

2. Obtain some weights for the Madry Lab model, following the readme
from their project (either download their presupplied weights or train
your own).

3. Set your MNIST_CHALLENGE_DIR environment variable to point to
the repository you cloned in step 1

4. Run

`python mnist/attack_model.py`

To run the attack on CIFAR-10

1. Clone the CIFAR-10 challenge repository from:
https://github.com/MadryLab/cifar10_challenge

2. Same as for MNIST

3. Set your CIFAR10_CHALLENGE_DIR environment variable to point to 
repository from step 1. 

4. Run

`python cifar10/attack_model.py`

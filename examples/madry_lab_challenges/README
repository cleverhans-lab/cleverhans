This example provides a CleverHans wrapper for the Madry Lab challenges.

To run the attack on MNIST:

1. Clone the MNIST challenge repository from:
https://github.com/MadryLab/mnist_challenge

2. Obtain some weights for the Madry Lab model, following the readme
from their project (either download their presupplied weights or train
your own).

3. Set your MNIST_CHALLENGE_DIR environment variable to point to
the repository you cloned in step 1

4. Run

python attack_model.py

# CleverHans [Future]

This folder contains (experimental) code that will eventually replace the
existing CleverHans package. In the future, CleverHans will support three
frameworks (JAX, PyTorch, and TF2). The package itself will focus on its
initial principle: reference implementation of attacks against machine learning
models to help with benchmarking models against adversarial examples.

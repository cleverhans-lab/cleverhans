"""
Multi-replica synchronous training


NOTE: This module is much more free to change than many other modules
in CleverHans. CleverHans is very conservative about changes to any
code that affects the output of benchmark tests (attacks, evaluation
methods, etc.). This module provides *model training* functionality
not *benchmarks* and thus is free to change rapidly to provide better
speed, accuracy, etc.
